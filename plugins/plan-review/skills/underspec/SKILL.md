description: Identify gaps in work-in-progress before proceeding. Use when refining plans, prompts, specs, or any collaborative artifact.

We're working together to refine this. Review what we have so far and identify anything underspecified or ambiguous - aspects that could cause confusion or lead to divergent interpretations if left unaddressed.

Ask clarifying questions to surface these gaps. When relevant, briefly note why the gap matters. Where solutions are obvious, suggest them after your questions.

Focus on comprehension, cohesion, and completeness of the overall direction.
